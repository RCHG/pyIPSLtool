library for IPSL data analysis in Python 
========================================================


**pyIPSLpack** is a collection of modules and functions created for the
data-analysis of IPSL-CM simulations. It has been created in the context
of the CRESCENDO project but it aims to be used in more contexts.

It uses several python libraries like xarray_, cartopy_, netCDF4_, matplotlib_, pandas_
It has been selected the cartopy library over the basemap as it will have more
long-term support.
