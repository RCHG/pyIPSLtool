How to use: running in TGCC cluster
===================================


**pyanalysisIPSL** has been developed initially for the analysis of
IPSL-CM simulations in the TGCC cluster, and other simulations within
CRESCENDO project. In long-term, part of their python methods will be
merged with ESMTool. 

**Machines** It is possible to use in other machines if the different 
libraries used are installed. Note however that given that the TGCC 
support of the several specific libraries required is only in 
python 2.7.14 the current version of pyanalysis-IPSL relies
on python 2.7 rather than python 3.

TGCC machines
-------------

**COBALT**

The current version has been developed for cobalt users as curie doesn't
have the required libraries. Also by request of the R. Checa-Garcia
the TGCC team installed cartopy, xarray, netCDF4 and other libraries.

**CURIE**

Currently not all the required libraries are supported.

**IRENE**

It shares the same modules than cobalt so its works fine also in this
HPC sever. Like in other cases, it is needed to load the python module as

> module load python/2.7.14 

before use any of the codes here described.



Cartopy-files
-------------

Normaly, cartopy first run download from several servers the mapping 
information. Given that TGCC users can not download files from extrnal
servers, they have to be installed manually by each users and cartopy
should be informed of that with the following piece of code,

.. code-block:: python

    from cartopy.io import Downloader

    # -- CARTOPY LOAD OF SHAPEFILES -----------------------------------------------------
    shaped='/ccc/cont003/home/dsm/checagar/.local/share/cartopy/shapefiles/'
    shapef=shaped+'natural_earth/physical/ne_110m_coastline.shp'
    Downloader.from_config(('shapefiles', 'natural_earth')).pre_downloaded_path_template=shapef
    Downloader.from_config(('shapefiles', 'natural_earth')).target_path_template=shapef


The above code should be present on any use of the library which aims to plots maps.
